# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This game is one of the most popular game in the world for everyone regardless of age that requires nothing but hands. However, my goal was to create a version of this game for people using different devices like laptops or mobiles. Game has simply rules and shows the scores at the end of page. User play with computer.
