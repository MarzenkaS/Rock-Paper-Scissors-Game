# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This game is one of the most popular game in the world for everyone regardless of age that requires nothing but hands. However, my goal was to create a version of this game for people using different devices like laptops or mobiles. Game has simply rules and shows the scores at the end of page. User play with computer.

### Lighthouse

- At beginning I had a problem with score performance to get it above 90. It was less then 80. To change that I had to add width and height for all images and compress the size of background image. That fixed a problem.
- But with accessibility was no issue to get high score with 100 out of 100.

- Lighthouse for desktop:
